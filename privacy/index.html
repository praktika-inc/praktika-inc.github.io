		<h1>Urso Privacy Policy</h1>
		<h2>About us</h2>
		<p>Urso is a mobile game that takes care of your mental health. Managed by PRAKTIKA, INC. (EIN 87-3267429).</p>
		<p>You can contact the dedicated person responsible for protecting personal data at "Urso" by sending an email to this address: hi@praktika.app.</p>
		<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all types of customer information that we collect through the mobile app.</p>
		<p>Important clarification: if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, we ask you to refrain from using our services.</p>
		<p>Before describing why, when, how, and what personal user data "Urso" collects and processes, let us explain some basic concepts about protecting personal data. We believe that this will allow you to better understand why we choose our way of processing personal data.</p>
		<h3>Personal Data</h3>
		<p>Personal data is any information about an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is a natural person that can be directly or indirectly identified, particularly by referring to a specific identifier (name, number, network identifier, email address) or to one or several specific elements of the physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural, or social identity of the individual.</p>
		<h3>Data Subject</h3>
		<p>A data subject is an individual that the personal data relates to and that can be identified by personal data or is identifiable.</p>
		<h3>Special Categories of Personal Data</h3>
		<p>We exclude or try to minimize the collection of such categories of data in our app, but they are worth mentioning. By such personal data, we mean anything that may cause harm to the data subject in personal life, at work, at the university, or may lead to discrimination. Such personal data usually reflects racial or ethnic origin, political views, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union memberships, or there is a processing of genetic and biometric data to uniquely identify an individual and gather data about the individual's health, sex life, or sexual orientation.</p>
		<h3>Personal Data Administrator</h3>
		<p>An administrator is a natural or legal person who determines the purposes and means of personal data processing and is primarily responsible for its processing. Unless otherwise specified in the terms or conditions for a particular service, the personal data administrator is the CEO of PRAKTIKA, INC., Anton Shayakhov.</p>
		<h3>Personal Data Operator</h3>
		<p>An operator is a natural or legal person that processes personal data for the administrator based on their instructions.</p>
		<h3>Personal Data Processing</h3>
		<p>Processing is any activity or a set of activities that are performed with personal data or sets of personal data with or without using automatic procedures, such as collecting, recording, systematizing, structuring, storing, refining or changing, searching, viewing, using, accessing during transfer, distributing or granting any access, arranging or combining, restricting, deleting, or destructing.</p>
		<h2>What Type of Information Do We Collect?</h2>
		<p>"Urso" is an app that helps users learn meditation. You can use our services without registering or after registering in the app. We do not collect your email.</p>
		<h2>How Long Is My Personal Data Stored?</h2>
		<p>Generally, we store the personal data we collect from users until it no longer satisfies the purpose for its collection. If, at any point, you want to opt out of personal data processing, you can always do so by sending an email to hi@praktika.app.</p>
		<p>Conversations, including emails sent to our support team, will be stored longer so that we will be able to access them for any subsequent inquiries. Such information is deleted after three years unless requested by law.</p>
		<p>Anonymous information about your activity is stored longer for statistical data and market research, but it is not associated with you and is anonymous. This is because we strive to improve our services and opportunities for more convenient communication, and our legitimate interest justifies such a storage period.</p>
		<h2>What Kind of Personal Information Is Collected About Minors?</h2>
		<p>“Urso” intentionally does not collect any information about minors. We do not encourage the use of our service by minors without the consent of legal representatives. If we are made aware that such data has been provided by a minor (as defined by the law of the user’s country of residence), and their personal data has been provided without the consent of their legal representatives, we will take measures to notify the data subject’s legal representatives to obtain appropriate permission or to delete the personal data of an underage data subject.</p>
		<h2>Does Urso Share My Personal Data?</h2>
		<p>We may share aggregate information with third parties, such as analytical, postal, and hosting providers. Such information includes your personal data (but which does not identify you directly) along with other information, including third-party data for audience analysis and quality improvement of our services. We share your data with the following categories of third parties:</p>
		<p>1. IT companies (hardware and software) that provide facilities and other services to support our service.</p>
		<p>2. Fraud prevention and anti-spam services to protect our platform from criminal activity.</p>
		<p>3. Moderators that monitor the steady operation of our service.</p>
		<p>4. Advertising partners and providers of targeted advertising.</p>
		<p>5. Law enforcement agencies if it’s necessary to provide data by law as well as to protect human life.</p>
		<p>6. Messaging services providers.</p>
		<p>We guarantee that these parties act in accordance with the data protection and confidentiality terms of this Policy and applicable personal data protection laws. We do our best to ensure that all data remains as anonymous as possible.</p>
		<p>In case Urso or any of our partners with legal possession of your data transfers business or changes ownership, for example, due to a takeover by another company or a merger, reorganization or sale of all or part of the assets, as well as insolvency, we may be required to disclose your personal information.</p>
